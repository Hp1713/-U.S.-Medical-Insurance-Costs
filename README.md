# -U.S.-Medical-Insurance-Costs
Python Project inclined to learn about CSV files and ways to interact with them

The purpose of this project is to have data from random users where the data contains the following:
  -age
  -gender
  -body mass index 
  -# of children
  -if smokers 
  -location 
  -insurance cost 
  
and according to this infromation I performed calculations that would give the desired values such as:
  -Number of males and females in the file 
  -Total average age
  -Male and female average age 
  -Average BMI (Body mass index)
  -Male and Female average BMI 
  -Average children person each person has (rounded to the nearest tenth)
  - Average smokers 
  - Average male and female smokers
